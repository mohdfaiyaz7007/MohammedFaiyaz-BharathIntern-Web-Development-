Registration Form Project
This project is a web-based registration form built using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. The application allows users to register by providing their personal details through a user-friendly interface. The front end, developed with HTML and CSS, ensures a responsive and visually appealing design. The back end, powered by Node.js, handles form submissions, data validation, and interactions with the MongoDB database. MongoDB is used for storing user information securely, enabling efficient data retrieval and management. This project demonstrates a full-stack approach to creating a functional registration system, integrating both client-side and server-side technologies.
